        <span className="italic"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹,  </span>  
        I'm Somto but you could call me Nathan,
        Front-end engineer with a solid background in current web technologies
        such as . <span className="font-medium">
        React, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Next.js
        </span> I also
        build mobile apps too with <span className="font-medium">React Native</span>. My love for web development
        started in the year 2021 when i first signed up on a little bird app
        called twitter or x. The way the interface was structured just made me
        fall in love. I wanted to know how to build such a thing, so after a few
        years of self learning i believe i am on track. If you love my passion
        why don't we connect and build something great together.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
        video games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I also enjoy{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently
        learning about{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">history and philosophy</span>. I'm also
        learning how to play the guitar.
